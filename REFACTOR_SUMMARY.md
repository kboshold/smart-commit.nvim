# Smart Commit Runner Refactoring Summary

## Overview

The `runner.lua` file has been successfully refactored from a single large file (~39KB, 1000+ lines) into multiple focused modules for better maintainability, testability, and code organization.

## New Structure

The runner has been split into the following modules:

### `/lua/smart-commit/runner/`

1. **`init.lua`** - Main runner module that orchestrates all other modules
   - Re-exports key functionality for backward compatibility
   - Coordinates between different subsystems
   - Maintains the same public API

2. **`state.lua`** - Task State Management
   - Manages task states and transitions
   - Handles task initialization and state updates
   - Provides safe state update functions
   - Manages task metadata (callbacks, dependencies, etc.)

3. **`executor.lua`** - Task Execution Engine
   - Handles different task types (handler, function, command)
   - Manages task execution flow
   - Coordinates with other modules for task completion

4. **`processes.lua`** - Process Management
   - Manages system processes and command execution
   - Handles process cleanup and termination
   - Tracks active processes for proper resource management

5. **`callbacks.lua`** - Callback System
   - Handles task callbacks (success/failure)
   - Supports function callbacks and task chaining
   - Manages callback arrays and complex callback scenarios

6. **`dependencies.lua`** - Dependency Management
   - Handles task dependency resolution
   - Manages task execution order
   - Processes task conditions and prerequisites

7. **`ui_manager.lua`** - UI Management
   - Manages UI updates and sign column
   - Handles task status display
   - Manages hierarchical task display (callbacks indented under parents)

8. **`timers.lua`** - Timer Management
   - Manages periodic UI updates
   - Handles spinner animations
   - Controls update frequency and cleanup

## Key Benefits

### 1. **Separation of Concerns**
- Each module has a single, well-defined responsibility
- Easier to understand and modify individual components
- Reduced cognitive load when working on specific features

### 2. **Improved Maintainability**
- Smaller, focused files are easier to navigate and modify
- Clear module boundaries make it easier to identify where changes should be made
- Reduced risk of unintended side effects when making changes

### 3. **Better Testability**
- Individual modules can be tested in isolation
- Easier to mock dependencies for unit testing
- Clear interfaces between modules

### 4. **Enhanced Readability**
- Related functionality is grouped together
- Clear module names indicate their purpose
- Reduced file size makes it easier to understand each component

### 5. **Backward Compatibility**
- All existing functionality is preserved
- Public API remains unchanged
- Existing configurations and usage patterns continue to work

## Migration Details

### What Changed
- Single `runner.lua` file split into 8 focused modules
- Internal organization and structure improved
- Module dependencies clearly defined

### What Stayed the Same
- All public APIs and functions
- Task execution behavior and logic
- Configuration format and options
- User-facing functionality

### Files Modified
- `lua/smart-commit/runner.lua` → `lua/smart-commit/runner/` (directory with 8 modules)
- No other files required changes due to backward compatibility

## Testing

The refactored runner has been tested to ensure:
- ✅ All modules load correctly
- ✅ Main smart-commit module loads successfully
- ✅ Task configuration and setup works
- ✅ Backward compatibility is maintained
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Future Benefits

This refactoring provides a solid foundation for:
- Adding new task execution types
- Implementing additional UI features
- Extending the callback system
- Adding more sophisticated dependency management
- Improving error handling and debugging
- Adding comprehensive unit tests

## File Size Comparison

- **Before**: Single `runner.lua` - 38,994 bytes
- **After**: 8 focused modules - Total ~40KB (similar size, much better organized)

The refactoring maintains the same functionality while providing a much more maintainable and extensible codebase.
